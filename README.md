Flask Logging Project

To gain practical experience with Linux servers, I created a small website logging system.
The goal was to run two Docker containers on a Linux server:

* The first container hosts a website where visitors can check their IP address.
* The second container handles logging. Each request is recorded with a timestamp in a .txt file.

Development was done on a virtual Ubuntu server in VirtualBox. Later, the project was also tested on a Debian server.
All connections to the servers were made exclusively via SSH from a WSL-Debian terminal on Windows.
The entire process was intentionally carried out in the terminal to simulate realistic server administration as closely as possible.

This is my first project of this kind, so I donâ€™t claim to fully understand every single line of code.
However, I do have a solid foundational knowledge of Linux, Docker, and Python, which was further deepened through this project.

**A note for transparency:**
The HTML and CSS files were generated with the help of ChatGPT. Since my focus was on Linux and Docker, I kept that part intentionally simple. That said, I still have a basic understanding of front-end development.
The rest of the project code was partially developed with assistance from ChatGPT, but never copied and pasted directly.
